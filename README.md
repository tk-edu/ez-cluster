# ez-cluster
An interface for running parallel programs on network computers

## Project Structure
The project currently has two main parts: frontend and backend. There are READMEs in each directory that explain specifics related to each part, so make sure to take a look at them ([backend README](https://github.com/tk-edu/ez-cluster/blob/main/backend/README.md), [frontend README](https://github.com/tk-edu/ez-cluster/blob/main/frontend/README.md))

## Suggested Commit Message Style
I like the commit message style that the [SerenityOS](https://github.com/SerenityOS/serenity/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#code-submission-policy) project uses. It has more or less the following form:  
```
<module>: <summary>

<optional detailed information>
```
## Code Review
